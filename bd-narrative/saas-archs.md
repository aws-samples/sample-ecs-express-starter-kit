For (Pre-Seed and Seed-stage aka early stage) SUPs, the focus is on rapid experimentation and short development cycles, adopting a structured "fail-fast" approach to validate product and technical hypotheses quickly

For ready to scale SUPs, moving from serving one of their customer to many require robust multi-tenancy and may be multi-country approaches while keeping the operations lean.

This session will establish the foundational elements of the SaaS mindset, giving attendees core architectural concepts and patterns to achieve those outcomes. Participants will learn how to implement these patterns using AWS technologies such as AWS Lambda, managed databases, and container platforms. The session will deep-dive into a prescriptive, hands-on approach to building SaaS architecture with ECS Express Mode, guiding participants through an end-to-end implementation on AWS technologies covering applications and databases.
The session will talk about SUP Passport program where we dive deep with selective SUPs on building scaleable and resilient architecture via more targeted engagements such as Data Sovereignty, Elasticity, Developer/Partner/Customer on-boarding and more.
