The rapid introduction of new models and tooling can be overwhelming. 
This session presents a production-ready AI applications architecture on AWS that enables teams to adopt new models across providers and adapt to a shifting landscape quickly. You will learn production-ready patterns for optimizing compute and inference using hybrid strategies, implementing AI and model observability, and designing agentic applications. Key topics include inference optimization, secure tool invocation, long-term memory strategies, semantic routing, and reusable building blocks for scalable AI systems.
